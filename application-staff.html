            You'll start off as a moderator. This means you'll be interacting with the community on a regular 
            basis, answering questions, keeping chat civil, and acting as an interface between the staff team
            and the community. You'll also have the pleasure of banning people who join and start spamming NSFW, 
            along with nuking spammers/x-rayers.<br><br>

            As a staff team, we have weekly meetings where we discuss the events of the last week and what the 
            next steps are going forward. Many critical server decisions are made in these meetings, and as a 
            staff member, you will have a not-so-subtle impact on how the server functions.<br><br>

            As such, we expect that you'll be willing to discuss issues at length, and come up with effective solutions. 
            If you remain in the staff team long enough and demonstrate good technical skills, you may be 
            offered a position as an administrator. As an administrator, you'll be actively maintaining the server, 
            and you'll be directly involved in developing new content as well as other complex technical tasks.<br><br>

            To summarise, you will need to:<br>
            <i data-feather="check" class = "image-icon-small-green"></i>
            play on the server regularly (about one hour a day on average)<br>

            That's all for requirements. I strongly recommend you save your answers to the application, in case the 
            submission process encounters any issues, and for you to refer to in the future. <br>
            
            Most of these question are <b>really</b> open-ended, and there is very rarely a 'right' answer. We just want
            to get a feel for who you are and whether you would be suitable for the team, so just write down whatever you
            personally would do in each situation, and make sure to explain your reasoning. Some of the questions can be
            difficult to answer, so don't worry if you don't get everything.<br><br>
            
            Remember, the more detailed your responses are, the better! Good luck.
