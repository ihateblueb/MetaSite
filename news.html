        <p class = "text monospace">
            Hi everyone,<br><br>

            As some of you might have noticed by now, Paper 1.18 went stable about an hour and a half 
            ago. This means that we finally have a date and time for the long-anticipated reset. It 
            will be occurring on Saturday 8th January, 10:00 CST / 11:00 EST / 16:00 GMT. For those of 
            you who haven't been following announcements, everything will be reset: all the worlds, 
            items, mcmmo levels, etc. The 'new' server will be completely reconfigured to use a new set 
            of plugins with new configurations, which will hopefully be far more maintainable, less 
            exploitable, and more streamlined. We'll have a new ranking system, a new spawn, new Slimefun 
            addons, and much, much more. All will be revealed on the 8th :)<br><br>

            Before then though, we'll also have a anarchy period as I've announced previously, so this is 
            your last chance to save your base schematics. This anarchy period begins Thursday 6th 
            January, 13:00 CST / 14:00 EST / 19:00 GMT and ends Saturday 8th January, 8:00 CST / 9:00 EST / 
            14:00 GMT. This does not mean that all rules can be ignored - it does mean that:<br>
            - Towny will be completely removed<br>
            - PVP will be enabled for all players globally<br>
            - Griefing and all forms of PVP are allowed<br><br>

            All the other existing rules apply! Please play fair. I'll see you on the 8th.<br><br>

            Hi all, quick announcement about the exploit recently discovered - I updated the server 
            yesterday to use the latest paper version (where the exploit has been patched). It should

        <p class = "text monospace">
            A couple of small updates.<br><br>

            1) I ran into multiple problems and large bugs with Sunlight. I considered moving back 
            to Essentials, but in the end concluded that it would be far better to move to CMI, 
            so we're now using that instead. It's also replacing many other plugins, so the plugin 
            count continues to decrease with the number of features staying the same.<br><br>

            2) I said a while back that we may give rewards to players that have gone sufficiently 
            far in Slimefun. I've decided to not go ahead with this. Sorry to those who have 
            progressed far in Slimefun. Hopefully you found the experience completely painfu - 
            I mean, enjoyable.<br><br>

            3) Keeping XP and inventory will be restricted behind the second and third ranks 
            respectively (assuming players start on the first rank when they join the server)<br><br>

            4) Voting will be a much bigger thing. There will be a server shop using points gained 
            by voting where things such as name tokens, lore tokens, warp tokens (yes, that's what 
            you think it is), claim blocks, XP, and some other stuff will be sold.<br><br>

            5) Absolutely no promises, but from what I've seen so far the number of API changes has 
            been very low, meaning that the plugins may be 1.18-ready sooner than expected.<br><br>

            6) There will be an anarchy period for 48 hours before the server resets. There will be 
            no server download available due to the world being 250GB, so if you want to keep your 
            builds, save them now using schematica/etc while you can. PVP will be enabled universally 
            and Towny will be removed entirely, though KeepInventory will still be enabled. I'll let 
            you know at least 24 hours before this begins.<br><br>

            Any questions, feel free to DM me.<br><br>

        <h class = "text monospace"><i>28/10/2021 - Idra</i></p>
        <p class = "text monospace">
            Hi everyone,<br><br>

            It's been a while since the last announcement I made regarding 1.18, so I thought 
            I would post an update for those interested. I've made a lot of progress in setting 
            up a new server for 1.18, and a lot has also changed since that last announcement, 
            so I'll also be detailing everything that is currently true of the new server. Keep 
            in mind that this is still subject to change and nothing is certain.<br><br>

            Firstly, I'd like to clarify that we will not be transferring anything, including 
            builds, McMMO levels, items, etc. This is a hard reset. We're now less sure about 
            whitelisting, and are now in the process of deciding whether to implement a 
            whitelist/application process and if so, how it should work.<br><br>

            The server is being split into two individual servers - a lobby server and a survival 
            server. The lobby will host events, contain the spawn, contain the (staff) creative 
            world, and hold new content that will be releasing tomorrow and the day after that. 
            Players will initially spawn here and will easily be able to travel to the survival 
            server. Chat will be maintained as one channel between both servers, both in-game 
            and on Discord (using separate bots).<br><br>
            
            This combined with bungeecord to link the servers will hopefully make this feel less 
            like a split of the current server, and more as an extension to it. To aid with this 
            transition, lots of plugins have been moved to using databases shared between both 
            servers as opposed to maintaining individual flatfile databases, which should hopefully 
            make data storage more reliable.<br><br>
            
            In terms of the survival server, we've decided to keep ranks and have a new system set 
            up for progressing through them, though I can't reveal any details about them yet. 
            There have been a huge number of other major and minor changes, but they're too extensive 
            to detail here, so I'll leave you with a list of the current plugins for both servers. 
            All of these have been full configured and are (probably?) working correctly (apart 
            from Terra which I hope to set up in the near future):<br><br>

        <h class = "heading big">Regex exploit explained</h><br>
        <h class = "text monospace"><i>19/09/2021 - Idra</i></p>
        <p class = "text monospace">
            So, here's vaguely what happened earlier, though not particularly detailed because I don't 
            understand regex in enough detail to figure out exactly what happened.<br><br>

            Multiverse is a plugin that lets us create and manage different worlds (such as a world to 
            contain the spawn and the resource world). Regex (Regular Expression) is a sequence of characters 
            that lets you perform searches on other sequences of characters (strings). While I'm unable to 
            figure out exactly why, the regex ^(.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.+)$^ takes 
            longer and longer to evaluate as you add more characters.<br><br>

            According to https://regexr.com/, 5 characters takes 10ms to parse, then at 6 characters this 
            balloons to 50ms, then at 7 characters 200ms, and keeps growing exponentially as you add more 
            characters. By the time you get to a hundred or so, it would probably take years to compute.<br><br>

            This exact expression was then parsed into multiverse's command engine by simply running /mv 
            ^(.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.+)$^. The command engine started trying to 
            execute the regex expression on some arbitrary data, most likely over a hundred characters long. 
            To be clear, this shouldn't have been possible - ideally the command arguments should not be 
            passed directly into a regex parser, because people can do stuff like this. The issue was reported 
            on Github in https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues/2702 5 days ago, and patched in 
            a snapshot which I promptly updated multiverse to.<br><br>

            Interestingly, when I tested the exploit on a locally hosted server, it took around a minute and 
            ten seconds to crash and shut down. However, the actual server continued running for 30 minutes 
            before I asked Void to manually restart it. Paper should automatically shut the server down once 
            the main thread has been stuck for so long, but for some reason it didn't in this instance. <br><br>

        <p class = "text monospace">
            I've recently felt burnt out with the server. This isn't what I want to do anymore. I've come to the 
            realisation that I simply can't put as much work into making this server run as I was hoping. 
            Yesterday, I had a long meeting with the rest of the staff team where we discussed how to run the 
            server long-term while preserving my sanity/mental health. We have made a lot of decisions that I 
            know many of you won't like, but this is largely necessary for the future of the server.<br><br>

            I will continue to minimally maintain the server in its current state while separately configuring 
            the server, from the ground up, for 1.18. There will be several key changes.<br><br>
            
            1) Towny is going. Towny is overly complex and to perform what should be simple actions, it takes a 
            string of obscure commands. It's also a nightmare to maintain. When we first started the server, we 
            chose Towny over other plugins because it encourages players to build communities and surround 
            themselves by other players. After some observation we realised that this isn't the case, and that 
            a similar claiming plugin would achieve largely the same tasks without the complexity and maintenance 
            issues. We're therefore switching to GriefPrevention.<br><br>

            2) ExcellentEnchants is going. The plugin is difficult to maintain and provides many opportunities 
            for exploiting, particularly paired with Slimefun. We feel that Slimefun's own items should somewhat 
            supplement this.<br><br>

            3) ChatGames are going. At this point, several people have memorised the answers to most of them, and 
            as a consequence few people actively engage with the chat games. They are a mere annoyance to the 
            majority of players.<br><br>

            4) Ranks are going. The current setup with McMMO doesn't fit our vision. We planned originally to use 
            a quest system paired with ranks to match ranking to Slimefun progression, but this has proven 
            extremely difficult to set up, and is ultimately not going to fix many of the issues with ranks. We 
            briefly considered adding playtime-based ranks but realised that this would have to be paired with 
            anti-AFK mechanisms, a route that we don't really want to take. Permissions from our current ranks 
            will be merged into the default permission set.<br><br>

            5) The server will move to a whitelist/application model. Rather than being completely public, players 
            will need to apply to be able to join the server, and their application must be reviewed by at least 
            two staff members before they are given whitelist access. All existing players will be automatically 
            whitelisted. This will reduce our growth, but will also be excellent for maintaining a mature 
            playerbase and having a small quantity of long-term players rather than a large quantity of short-term 
            ones. We will provide clear directions for new players on how to apply, most likely using Discord or 
            our server website.<br><br>

            6) There won't be a poll to reset for 1.18. I hate to make this decision, but resetting will allow 
            me to implement the changes that I wish to make, and as I've discussed at length, will likely be 
            healthy for the community in the long term.<br><br>

            7) Economy is going. It's a pain to balance and maintain, and a large number of unrelated decisions 
            end up heavily concerning economy because it is so ubiquitous. We feel that switching commerce to a 
            trading/bartering system where only items can be exchange will also help with existing balance 
            problems, and encourage more communication between players.<br><br>

            To clarify, warnings and bans will not be wiped.<br><br>

            Thanks for your understanding. <br><br>

            Apologies for the downtime, there was an issue on my end (I'm still unsure what exactly) that resulted

            the server for now, if anything is still wrong then let me know. Compressed Machines hasn't loaded 
            though, so we're switching to Slime Customizer variants sooner than planned. If you had any compressed

            refund them with new versions as soon as replacements are implemented.<br><br>

            Also, we've now switched back to the regular Slimefun.jar file, meaning there may be issues with saving

        <h class = "heading big">A 1.18 reset?</h><br>
        <h class = "text monospace"><i>23/08/2021 - Idra</i></p>
        <p class = "text monospace">
            The chat continues to erupt into debate every time the topic of a reset comes up, so here's a Q&A to hopefully 
            address the most important questions. However, I want to emphasise that nothing is certain right now. 
            Everything I say here is subject to change.<br><br>

            This is also available as a blog post on <a href = "https://metamechanists.enjin.com/" class = "text link">
            https://metamechanists.enjin.com/</a>.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Will there be a reset? When?</h><br>
            If we want to update the main server to 1.18, there has to be a reset due to changes in world generation. 
            However, there will be a poll if we want to 1) update to 1.18 with a reset or 2) stay on 1.17 some time 
            longer. If the second option is the most popular, we will likely eventually launch a second server to run 
            alongside with 1.18, as an update is simply necessary for the community's future for reasons I will describe 
            next.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Why are we considering a reset?</h><br>
            The reasons are extremely extensive, but I will try to compact the main three reasons here. 1) Chunk 
            generation is taking a significant amount of processing power. The solution to this is world pregeneration. 
            However, the current world is already 250 gigabytes, so pregenerating all the chunks would inflate the file 
            size such that it is unmanageable. 2) The server is currently difficult to maintain. A reset would give me 
            the opportunity to reconfigure plugins from the ground up and compact multiple plugins into one (which is 
            better for performance as well as bugs and maintenance). 3) This server has been running for almost a year 
            and many people are starting to approach Slimefun's endgame by the means of infinity expansion. With a reset, 
            we could reconfigure parts of Slimefun to significantly improve and streamline progression. This, coupled 
            with a level playing field for all players, would make playing on the server more enjoyable. 4) Perhaps the 
            most obvious reason, 1.18 uses different chunk generation and this will be incompatible with our current 
            world. It's therefore necessary to reset if we want to update to 1.18.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Build transfers</h><br>
            This is something I'm afraid will probably not transfer in the event of a reset. I've discovered that WorldEdit 
            is not very practical for transferring the large number of builds that exist on the server, and corruption, 
            lost builds, and problems with transferring are likely.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Item transfers</h><br>
            The answer to this question ties in with reason 3 that we're considering a reset. We'd like to provide a 
            level playing field for all players and this is not possible with (especially) item transfer. In addition, 
            if progression is significantly changed this may lead to a larger imbalance between early and endgame players 
            than there may have been initially. It's therefore unlikely that we will transfer any items - however! We're 
            considering giving a reward to players who progress sufficiently far in Slimefun that will transfer over the 
            reset. If this becomes a reality, we will announce the conditions far in advance of the deadline to give 
            everyone time to prepare. As a side note, researches will likely not transfer.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">McMMO, jobs, and economy</h><br>
            These abstract possessions are one of the few things that might be transferred, but I am still sceptical, 
            largely for the reasons I listed in the previous answers: I want to provide a level playing field, and major 
            changes may be made to the balance of McMMO, jobs, and (especially) economy. Some form of transfer may or may 
            not be provided, but this is perhaps the largest grey area.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Main worlds</h><br>
            Obviously, a large attraction of 1.18 is world generation, and thus the main world will be generated with this. 
            However, we may also consider setting up a second world which uses custom world generation to allow for some 
            flexibility with building. Both of these worlds will be fully pregenerated and have a world border significantly 
            smaller than today, to prevent large world file sizes and performance loss from chunk generation.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Resource world</h><br>
            The resource world will likely no longer be a thing, as the complexity of having it is simply not worth it, 
            especially with chunk pregeneration in the main worlds. Even prior to introducing it we didn't have problems 
            with rampant destruction in the main world. If it becomes an issue, we will re-introduce the resource 
            world.<br><br>

            Hi everyone,<br><br>

            I think I'm now fairly close to figuring out the cause of all the recent bugs, but experimentation will have to 
            be done on a test server, much of it is far too dangerous to do on the actual live server, even with backups. 
            Therefore I'm going to need to perform a download of a large number of server files (namely the entire plugins 
            folder excluding dynmap, and the resource world). I don't know how long it will take but hopefully won't be longer 
            than a couple of millennia 3-6 hours. I will be able to get a more precise estimate once the download starts. 
            We're currently 2 hours in. 7 GB transferred and 42.8 GB of data to go. Still don't have a good estimate for time, 
            but it will take a while. (2h40m in - FTP's estimate is another 2 hours)<br><br>

            The downtime will start at in 20 minutes, 1am BST (19:00 CST and 20:00 EST). Thanks for your patience.<br><br>

            The server finished transferring a short while ago and we're ready to start it again. My apologies again for the 
            inconvenience, I severely underestimated the size of the server (I blame y'all for making the world 200 gigabytes 
            large) and so it took far longer than expected to transfer. Regardless, we are now up again, under the IP of 
            obelisk.game-server.cc<br><br>

            Though I know we can't compensate the time everyone has lost, as partial compensation we will have double  McMMO

            I'd also like to take this opportunity to announce some new ranks we've put in place to help with server events

            take part in the test, let me know and I will show you how to use the multiblocks (as the interface is not particularly 
            intuitive at the moment). During the test, I will attempt to find and fix as many bugs as possible, and solve any 
            performance or UI issues that may pop up, particularly over a long time period.<br><br>

            If you partake in the testing, please report any of your findings in #deleted-channel or send them to me, so I can 
            investigate further. Thanks for reading :)<br><br>

            Hi all,<br><br>

            Recently I've been running profiles to help determine the cause of recent server lag. The main (preventable) culprit 
            seems to be bees and villagers. I'd like to ask everyone who has bees or villagers to, if possible, move them away 
            from your main base (so they are loaded less often) and/or spread them out more (entity collisions are very CPU 
            intensive). Thanks in advance :)<br><br>

        <h class = "heading big">Slimefun incompatibilities</h><br>
        <h class = "text monospace"><i>29/05/2021 - Idra</i></p>
        <p class = "text monospace">
            Hi @Announcements , I think you deserve an explanation about the fiasco that happened earlier.<br><br>

            A couple of months ago, several slimefun addons broke after an incompatibility occurred with the latest version of 
            slimefun. To ensure this didn't happen again (particularly with a larger playerbase), I manually disabled auto updates 
            for many of the addons we had at the time. Unbeknown to me, claytech (which was at the centre of the incompatibility) 
            had broken because it had recently been abandoned. I occasionally manually updated the addons by checking for 
            incompatibilities in a test server, then uploading them to the main server.<br><br>

            This was all well and good until today, when infinity expansion automatically updated (I left updates for this enabled 
            because it was not previously affected by any incompatibilities). The new infinity expansion update made use of what I 
            believe was a new piece of code for handling menus, which hadn't yet been implemented in the server's slimefun version, 
            and so the plugin failed to load entirely. Normally this wouldn't be an issue because the addon's blocks would not 
            have been handled at this stage, but the error seems to have occurred after the blocks were loaded, evidently causing a 
            signifcant number of slimefun blocks to revert to vanilla blocks or vanish, along with their cargo connectors.<br><br>

            The whole thing was further complicated by the fact that we had made two major adjustments to the addons which directly 
            involved infinity expansion, so it was unclear what exactly was causing the issue; thus it took several adjustments and 
            restarts to realise the root of the problem was a version incompatibility. Once this was determined, I copied across 
            all the plugin .jar files from the test server, which was still loading correctly. That has fixed the problem for every 
            plugin.<br><br>

            To counteract anything like this happening in the future, I've re-enabled auto-updates for every slimefun addon. I've 
            also discovered that Poma expansion has been abandoned (the main repository has been deleted with no further 
            information) so we've decided to remove this from the server.<br><br>

            If you have lost any items, please message me or an administrator, and we'll attempt to sort it out<br><br>

            Hello everyone Jenkins here, a.k.a redstonepowder.<br>
            I've been marking out an area with a community project in mind.  A public wither skeleton perimeter 
            to be more specific.<br><br>

            The goal here is to let everyone have a little fun on the server that does not involve slimefun.<br><br>

            I'm sure there will be many questions about this so I'll try to pre-emptively answer some of them here. 
            Feel free to ask me anything I haven't covered in this announcement.<br><br>

            1. What is a wither skeleton perimeter?<br><
            It is essentially a wither skeleton farm, but with a LOT of space mined out around it to reduce any 
            lag that the farm would produce.<br><br>

            2. How does this work and what're we doing?<br>
            The idea is to have volunteers come and help dig out the marked area and maybe even help build the 
            farm. Special equipment will be supplied to help out in this event. (It's a secret unless you join 
            :p)<br><br>

            3. Do I HAVE to go?<br>
            No, this is strictly volunteers only.<br><br>

            4. What do I get if I participate?<br>
            Aside from having fun destroying the landscape, you also get to keep whatever you break and destroy. 
            You can also keep some special equipment along with treasures that you may find. You'll also help 
            finish it faster, meaning there will be a quick source of wither skulls, coal and exp.<br><br>

            5. What happens if no one volunteers?<br>
            Well, first off, I'd feel depressed because no one w- nah joking.<br>
            I'll still be working on it, so it'll eventually be completed, just much more slowly, and you'll 
            still have access to the farm.<br><br>

            6. How do I get to the perimeter?<br>
            Use /warp CommProj<br><br>

            If you have any further questions, or want to volunteer, go ahead and msg me.<br>
            P.S: Special equipment will be provided later, because this announcement got rushed.<br><br>

            Okay, enough is enough. This is not an anarchy server. I've written a script that allows you

            raider will be banned for 3 days and the damage will be reverted<br>
            - Exceptions to these rules (eg: if two towns wish to go to war) should go through me first<br><br>
