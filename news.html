            Hi everyone! I have not one, but two announcements to make!

            <b>Spawn opening next week</b>
            Our build team (Aria and her minions Sky and Kimchi, with help from the 
            rest of the staff team) have been hard at work on a new spawn, which we'll be opening 
            next week on Friday 3pm CST / 4pm EST / 21 GMT. We've been working on the spawn for the 
            past month, and it has plenty of new stuff for you to explore, including several armour 
            stand scenes that neither me nor Sky approve of. We hope to see you there! <br><br>


            <b>New voting rewards</b>
            We've seen a decline in the number of votes over the past month or so, which has had a 
            very adverse affect on server growth. In lieu of this, we have developed a new system 
            over the past few weeks that takes a more traditional approach using crates, which is 
            releasing today. The rewards are hopefully suitable for both new players, and those who 
            have been playing for some time. There are six different crates, which you can explore at 
            /warp crates. From now on, voting sites will give vote keys, which can be used at /warp 
            crates.<br><br>

            I'm also aware many of you will have stockpiles of points that you haven't yet done 
            anything with. I've added an option in the vote shop which allows you to obtain a single 
            vote key in exchange for a single point. The rest of the options in /shop will still be 
            available for the next week (until 10/04/2022), but after that, the point system will be 
            disabled along with /shop. If you have any points, make sure to spend them ASAP, as points 
            that you keep after the deadline will be useless! A reminder will be posted one day before 
            points are disabled to give you a bit more time.<br><br>

            If you have any feedback on the crates system (particularly on the rewards), please do drop 
            us a line in #suggestions.
        </p>

            Hi everyone, Networks has been updated to build #34. This means that a new type of 
            storage has been implemented which replaces memory shells. Memory shells have stopped 
            working, but you can easily switch them to the new storage type using /networks replacecard. 
            If you have any questions or find any issues, please open a ticket in tickets.

            <i>[13:25 GMT]</i> Update from my contact at the ISP it's not a dead modem. It's their 
            network being down lol. I thought it was my modem because on my remote management 
            software for all of my customers around town I could see that their computers were all 
            online and connected so I thought it was just my network. They have four technicians at 
            the office and they've been at the office since 3:00 this morning when the outage 
            happened so I'm sure they'll get it up and running shortly.

            Sorry about the crash yesterday... It seems that the server ran out of memory, but it's 
            not entirely clear what caused this. I imagine that the chunk pregeneration had something 
            to do with it. This is why TPS was so low leading up to the crash. Thankfully no data has 
            been lost as far as I know, and chunk pregeneration has finished completely so there should 
            hopefully be no more incidents.

            Advance warning: TPS is going to be lower than usual for the next couple of days as we 
            pregenerate chunks across all worlds. Once this is done, TPS should be much improved 
            though, so please bear with us :)

            Advance warning: The world border will be shrinking from 32k to 17k in 5 days (28/02/2022). 
            The nether border will not be affected, but building portals more than roughly 2k blocks 
            out will result in the end point appearing outside the world border. Building portals more 
            than 2k blocks out is not advised. If you have anything more than 17k blocks from spawn on 
            the X or Z axis, contact me.

            Advance warning: TranscEndence will be removed in 5 days (28/02/2022) due to a it having 
            a lot of issues that are outside of my control. I don't recommend you create any new items 
            from TranscEndence from now until that date, as they'll be useless once the plugin has been

            Hi everyone,<br><br>

            I've uploaded a set of polls for people to vote on which can be found on 
            <a href = "https://discord.com/invite/6Ew8BYxUtZ" class = "text-link">Discord</a> in #polls. Feel 
            free to vote on whatever you want and leave the other polls blank, but at least a couple of votes 
            would be greatly appreciated. This is your chance to get a say in the how the server is run! Feel 
            free to discuss your opinions in #general.<br><br>

            The channel will stay indefinitely and will be used for future polls. In light of this, I've added 
            the @Polls rank which you can get by reacting to the message in rules-and-info. This rank will be 
            tagged whenever a new poll or set of polls are released.<br><br>

            Thanks all :)

            THE RESET IS FINALLY HERE! I'd like to extend my deepest thanks to the 
            entire staff team for all their support throughout this process, and for their extensive 
            efforts in testing the new server. Thanks to them, I've been able to patch an outrageous 
            number of game-breaking bugs before the server is live.<br><br>

            So what's new? Well, this is going to be a long one. In no particular order:<br><br>

            <b>WEBSITE</b><br>
            We have a new website! For now it's hosted on the same machine as the
            Minecraft servers. This will allow people to keep up with server news, changelogs, 
            and access other important information if they can't or don't want to join Discord.<br><br>


            <b>RANKS</b><br>
            Ranks are now based on Slimefun, and implemented using a custom plugin. 
            To rank up, you'll need to craft increasingly difficult sets of Slimefun items. 
            You can find out the requirements and rewards using /rank or on our website 
            <a href = "ranks" class = "text-link">here</a>. Also, our ranks are now
            themed after celestial bodies. You'll start at Mercury and work your way up
            to Neptune.<br><br>


            <b>STAFF</b><br>
            Staff rank names have changed:
            - Assistants are now Stars
            - Helpers are now Constellations
            - Admins are now Galaxies
            As a rule of thumb, if you need help with something, ask anyone who has a
            bold rank name.<br><br>


            <b>SPAWN</b><br>
            Our build team has been working hard on a new winter-themed snowglobe spawn. Sadly, the 
            release has been delayed by almost a month due to all the delays leading up to 1.18, so
            you won't get to enjoy it over Christmas. Maybe next year? Regardless, I'm sure you'll
            agree that the build is phenomenal, and hopefully you can all enjoy it regardless of
            the date.<br><br>


            <b>EVENTS</b><br>
            There's an event at spawn: the build team has hidden numbered presents around the map. 
            Your task is to screenshot all of them, and send the screenshots to me or @Aria.
            Good luck! (you'll need it, the build team did NOT hold back with this one)<br><br>


            <b>RULES</b><br>
            Rules have been updated! You can view the new rules in rules-and-info, at spawn, 
            or on our website <a href = "rules" class = "text-link">here</a><br><br>


            <b>LOBBY/SURVIVAL SYSTEM</b><br>
            We're now using BungeeCord and two individual servers (Lobby and Survival). This
            has enabled several things that would previously not have been possible, and gives
            us much more flexibility in setting up events and such. To change between servers,
            you can use /server survival or /server lobby.<br><br>



            <b>MCMMO</b><br>
            We had to make a last minute change here. Due to some problems with the legacy versions of 
            McMMO, we've had to switch to an alternative called Aurelium Skills. This revolves around 
            the same concept of skills and abilities, but adds some interesting new stuff and is more
            modern than McMMO. It should be fairly intuitive if you've used McMMO, but I expect it will
            take some time to get used to.<br><br>


            <b>TOWNY</b><br>
            Towny has been replaced with GriefPrevention. The fact is that towny is unfortunately a 
            giant mess of commands which is a nightmare to both use and maintain. GriefPrevention
            isn't quite as powerful, but is far more intuitive and should function absolutely fine
            as a replacement.<br><br>


            <b>SLIMEFUN ADDONS</b><br>
            Most of the addons have been kept, and I've added two new plugins: DankTech2 (adds backpacks with 
            functionality such as auto-deleting specific items), and Networks (adds a digital item 
            storage system, compatible with Infinity Expansion storage units). Also, Galactifun is
            (probably) working now.<br><br>


            <b>VOTING</b><br>
            Voting is a bigger thing now. Voting will give you vote points which can be used in 
            the new /shop to buy things such as warp tokens and claim blocks.<br><br>


            <b>PLUGIN CHANGES</b><br>
            I've hugely reduced the plugin count. A lot of unecessary features have been
            removed, but some new stuff has also been added. A full list of plugins, old and new, can
            be found on our website <a href = "plugins" class = "text-link">here</a><br><br>


            <b>CONTENT CREATOR ROLES</b><br>
            We have a new Discord role: content creator. This role grants permission to post in self-promo.
            Those with the streamer role will also be able to ping everyone subscribed to streams notifications.
            The content creator role is handed out to anyone who consistently makes content related to the server.
            This can be anything from youtube videos to 3D renders to animations to fanfiction. If you're unsure
            if you qualify, feel free to DM me.<br><br>


            <b>MODERATION</b><br>
            transparency-log is now fully automated, and the warning system has been moved in-game. You can view
            your warnings using /warnings. Punishments are now automatically applied by a ban management plugin.<br><br>


            <b>DYNMAP</b><br>
            Dynmap is gone. The reason for this is that the Dynmap plugin is a horrendous mess. It's an absolute 
            nightmare to maintain. Additionally, on the old server, Dynmap was responsible for over 80 GB of files 
            (for context, the whole server was around 300 GB) which is ridiculous. Though the functionality is nice, 
            it's just not worth it.<br><br>


            <b>/RTP</b><br>
            Random teleportation is still a thing, but is on a cooldown of 5 minutes, because the world size on the 
            previous server got really out of hand (120 GB for the overworld)<br><br>

            Hi everyone,<br><br>

            As some of you might have noticed by now, Paper 1.18 went stable about an hour and a half 
            ago. This means that we finally have a date and time for the long-anticipated reset. It 
            will be occurring on Saturday 8th January, 10:00 CST / 11:00 EST / 16:00 GMT. For those of 
            you who haven't been following announcements, everything will be reset: all the worlds, 
            items, mcmmo levels, etc. The 'new' server will be completely reconfigured to use a new set 
            of plugins with new configurations, which will hopefully be far more maintainable, less 
            exploitable, and more streamlined. We'll have a new ranking system, a new spawn, new Slimefun 
            addons, and much, much more. All will be revealed on the 8th :)<br><br>

            Before then though, we'll also have a anarchy period as I've announced previously, so this is 
            your last chance to save your base schematics. This anarchy period begins Thursday 6th 
            January, 13:00 CST / 14:00 EST / 19:00 GMT and ends Saturday 8th January, 8:00 CST / 9:00 EST / 
            14:00 GMT. This does not mean that all rules can be ignored - it does mean that:<br>
            - Towny will be completely removed<br>
            - PVP will be enabled for all players globally<br>
            - Griefing and all forms of PVP are allowed<br><br>

            All the other existing rules apply! Please play fair. I'll see you on the 8th.<br><br>

            In other news, we're still waiting on paper 1.18 to go stable. I've tried setting up the server 
            using Spigot 1.18 in the hope that it could be switched to paper later, but there are multiple 
            issues (most notably Slimefun loading problems and server crashes) which I'm almost certain can 
            only be fixed by using paper instead, so it seems we're stuck for now. If you're curious you 
            can follow Paper development here https://papermc.io/downloads.<br><br>

            Hi all, still no updates on 1.18 I'm afraid. We're still waiting for paper to update, and even 
            the developers of paper don't have an ETA. I'll let you know if anything happens, and hopefully

            A couple of small updates.<br><br>

            1) I ran into multiple problems and large bugs with Sunlight. I considered moving back 
            to Essentials, but in the end concluded that it would be far better to move to CMI, 
            so we're now using that instead. It's also replacing many other plugins, so the plugin 
            count continues to decrease with the number of features staying the same.<br><br>

            2) I said a while back that we may give rewards to players that have gone sufficiently 
            far in Slimefun. I've decided to not go ahead with this. Sorry to those who have 
            progressed far in Slimefun. Hopefully you found the experience completely painfu - 
            I mean, enjoyable.<br><br>

            3) Keeping XP and inventory will be restricted behind the second and third ranks 
            respectively (assuming players start on the first rank when they join the server)<br><br>

            4) Voting will be a much bigger thing. There will be a server shop using points gained 
            by voting where things such as name tokens, lore tokens, warp tokens (yes, that's what 
            you think it is), claim blocks, XP, and some other stuff will be sold.<br><br>

            5) Absolutely no promises, but from what I've seen so far the number of API changes has 
            been very low, meaning that the plugins may be 1.18-ready sooner than expected.<br><br>

            6) There will be an anarchy period for 48 hours before the server resets. There will be 
            no server download available due to the world being 250GB, so if you want to keep your 
            builds, save them now using schematica/etc while you can. PVP will be enabled universally 
            and Towny will be removed entirely, though KeepInventory will still be enabled. I'll let 
            you know at least 24 hours before this begins.<br><br>

        <p class = "text-news-content">
            Hi everyone,<br><br>

            It's been a while since the last announcement I made regarding 1.18, so I thought 
            I would post an update for those interested. I've made a lot of progress in setting 
            up a new server for 1.18, and a lot has also changed since that last announcement, 
            so I'll also be detailing everything that is currently true of the new server. Keep 
            in mind that this is still subject to change and nothing is certain.<br><br>

            Firstly, I'd like to clarify that we will not be transferring anything, including 
            builds, McMMO levels, items, etc. This is a hard reset. We're now less sure about 
            whitelisting, and are now in the process of deciding whether to implement a 
            whitelist/application process and if so, how it should work.<br><br>

            The server is being split into two individual servers - a lobby server and a survival 
            server. The lobby will host events, contain the spawn, contain the (staff) creative 
            world, and hold new content that will be releasing tomorrow and the day after that. 
            Players will initially spawn here and will easily be able to travel to the survival 
            server. Chat will be maintained as one channel between both servers, both in-game 
            and on <a href = "https://discord.com/invite/6Ew8BYxUtZ" class = "text-link">Discord</a> (using separate bots).<br><br>
            
            This combined with bungeecord to link the servers will hopefully make this feel less 
            like a split of the current server, and more as an extension to it. To aid with this 
            transition, lots of plugins have been moved to using databases shared between both 
            servers as opposed to maintaining individual flatfile databases, which should hopefully 
            make data storage more reliable.<br><br>
            
            In terms of the survival server, we've decided to keep ranks and have a new system set 
            up for progressing through them, though I can't reveal any details about them yet. 
            There have been a huge number of other major and minor changes, but they're too extensive 
            to detail here, so I'll leave you with a list of the current plugins for both servers. 
            All of these have been full configured and are (probably?) working correctly (apart 
            from Terra which I hope to set up in the near future):<br><br>

            So, here's vaguely what happened earlier, though not particularly detailed because I don't 
            understand regex in enough detail to figure out exactly what happened.<br><br>

            Multiverse is a plugin that lets us create and manage different worlds (such as a world to 
            contain the spawn and the resource world). Regex (Regular Expression) is a sequence of characters 
            that lets you perform searches on other sequences of characters (strings). While I'm unable to 
            figure out exactly why, the regex ^(.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.+)$^ takes 
            longer and longer to evaluate as you add more characters.<br><br>

            According to https://regexr.com/, 5 characters takes 10ms to parse, then at 6 characters this 
            balloons to 50ms, then at 7 characters 200ms, and keeps growing exponentially as you add more 
            characters. By the time you get to a hundred or so, it would probably take years to compute.<br><br>

            This exact expression was then parsed into multiverse's command engine by simply running /mv 
            ^(.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.+)$^. The command engine started trying to 
            execute the regex expression on some arbitrary data, most likely over a hundred characters long. 
            To be clear, this shouldn't have been possible - ideally the command arguments should not be 
            passed directly into a regex parser, because people can do stuff like this. The issue was reported 
            on Github in https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues/2702 5 days ago, and patched in 
            a snapshot which I promptly updated multiverse to.<br><br>

            Interestingly, when I tested the exploit on a locally hosted server, it took around a minute and 
            ten seconds to crash and shut down. However, the actual server continued running for 30 minutes 
            before I asked Void to manually restart it. Paper should automatically shut the server down once 
            the main thread has been stuck for so long, but for some reason it didn't in this instance. <br><br>

            I've recently felt burnt out with the server. This isn't what I want to do anymore. I've come to the 
            realisation that I simply can't put as much work into making this server run as I was hoping. 
            Yesterday, I had a long meeting with the rest of the staff team where we discussed how to run the 
            server long-term while preserving my sanity/mental health. We have made a lot of decisions that I 
            know many of you won't like, but this is largely necessary for the future of the server.<br><br>

            I will continue to minimally maintain the server in its current state while separately configuring 
            the server, from the ground up, for 1.18. There will be several key changes.<br><br>
            
            1) Towny is going. Towny is overly complex and to perform what should be simple actions, it takes a 
            string of obscure commands. It's also a nightmare to maintain. When we first started the server, we 
            chose Towny over other plugins because it encourages players to build communities and surround 
            themselves by other players. After some observation we realised that this isn't the case, and that 
            a similar claiming plugin would achieve largely the same tasks without the complexity and maintenance 
            issues. We're therefore switching to GriefPrevention.<br><br>

            2) ExcellentEnchants is going. The plugin is difficult to maintain and provides many opportunities 
            for exploiting, particularly paired with Slimefun. We feel that Slimefun's own items should somewhat 
            supplement this.<br><br>

            3) ChatGames are going. At this point, several people have memorised the answers to most of them, and 
            as a consequence few people actively engage with the chat games. They are a mere annoyance to the 
            majority of players.<br><br>

            4) Ranks are going. The current setup with McMMO doesn't fit our vision. We planned originally to use 
            a quest system paired with ranks to match ranking to Slimefun progression, but this has proven 
            extremely difficult to set up, and is ultimately not going to fix many of the issues with ranks. We 
            briefly considered adding playtime-based ranks but realised that this would have to be paired with 
            anti-AFK mechanisms, a route that we don't really want to take. Permissions from our current ranks 
            will be merged into the default permission set.<br><br>

            5) The server will move to a whitelist/application model. Rather than being completely public, players 
            will need to apply to be able to join the server, and their application must be reviewed by at least 
            two staff members before they are given whitelist access. All existing players will be automatically 
            whitelisted. This will reduce our growth, but will also be excellent for maintaining a mature 
            playerbase and having a small quantity of long-term players rather than a large quantity of short-term 
            ones. We will provide clear directions for new players on how to apply, most likely using 
            <a href = "https://discord.com/invite/6Ew8BYxUtZ" class = "text-link">Discord</a> or 
            our server website.<br><br>

            6) There won't be a poll to reset for 1.18. I hate to make this decision, but resetting will allow 
            me to implement the changes that I wish to make, and as I've discussed at length, will likely be 
            healthy for the community in the long term.<br><br>

            7) Economy is going. It's a pain to balance and maintain, and a large number of unrelated decisions 
            end up heavily concerning economy because it is so ubiquitous. We feel that switching commerce to a 
            trading/bartering system where only items can be exchange will also help with existing balance 
            problems, and encourage more communication between players.<br><br>

            To clarify, warnings and bans will not be wiped.<br><br>

            Apologies for the downtime, there was an issue on my end (I'm still unsure what exactly) that resulted 
            in Slimefun recompiling on an older version that all addons are now incompatible with. I'm re-opening

        <p class = "text-news-content">
            The chat continues to erupt into debate every time the topic of a reset comes up, so here's a Q&A to hopefully 
            address the most important questions. However, I want to emphasise that nothing is certain right now. 
            Everything I say here is subject to change.<br><br>

            This is also available as a blog post on <a href = "https://metamechanists.enjin.com/" class = "text-link">
            https://metamechanists.enjin.com/</a>.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Will there be a reset? When?</h><br>
            If we want to update the main server to 1.18, there has to be a reset due to changes in world generation. 
            However, there will be a poll if we want to 1) update to 1.18 with a reset or 2) stay on 1.17 some time 
            longer. If the second option is the most popular, we will likely eventually launch a second server to run 
            alongside with 1.18, as an update is simply necessary for the community's future for reasons I will describe 
            next.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Why are we considering a reset?</h><br>
            The reasons are extremely extensive, but I will try to compact the main three reasons here. 1) Chunk 
            generation is taking a significant amount of processing power. The solution to this is world pregeneration. 
            However, the current world is already 250 gigabytes, so pregenerating all the chunks would inflate the file 
            size such that it is unmanageable. 2) The server is currently difficult to maintain. A reset would give me 
            the opportunity to reconfigure plugins from the ground up and compact multiple plugins into one (which is 
            better for performance as well as bugs and maintenance). 3) This server has been running for almost a year 
            and many people are starting to approach Slimefun's endgame by the means of infinity expansion. With a reset, 
            we could reconfigure parts of Slimefun to significantly improve and streamline progression. This, coupled 
            with a level playing field for all players, would make playing on the server more enjoyable. 4) Perhaps the 
            most obvious reason, 1.18 uses different chunk generation and this will be incompatible with our current 
            world. It's therefore necessary to reset if we want to update to 1.18.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Build transfers</h><br>
            This is something I'm afraid will probably not transfer in the event of a reset. I've discovered that WorldEdit 
            is not very practical for transferring the large number of builds that exist on the server, and corruption, 
            lost builds, and problems with transferring are likely.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Item transfers</h><br>
            The answer to this question ties in with reason 3 that we're considering a reset. We'd like to provide a 
            level playing field for all players and this is not possible with (especially) item transfer. In addition, 
            if progression is significantly changed this may lead to a larger imbalance between early and endgame players 
            than there may have been initially. It's therefore unlikely that we will transfer any items - however! We're 
            considering giving a reward to players who progress sufficiently far in Slimefun that will transfer over the 
            reset. If this becomes a reality, we will announce the conditions far in advance of the deadline to give 
            everyone time to prepare. As a side note, researches will likely not transfer.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">McMMO, jobs, and economy</h><br>
            These abstract possessions are one of the few things that might be transferred, but I am still sceptical, 
            largely for the reasons I listed in the previous answers: I want to provide a level playing field, and major 
            changes may be made to the balance of McMMO, jobs, and (especially) economy. Some form of transfer may or may 
            not be provided, but this is perhaps the largest grey area.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Main worlds</h><br>
            Obviously, a large attraction of 1.18 is world generation, and thus the main world will be generated with this. 
            However, we may also consider setting up a second world which uses custom world generation to allow for some 
            flexibility with building. Both of these worlds will be fully pregenerated and have a world border significantly 
            smaller than today, to prevent large world file sizes and performance loss from chunk generation.<br><br>

            <h class = "heading small">Resource world</h><br>
            The resource world will likely no longer be a thing, as the complexity of having it is simply not worth it, 
            especially with chunk pregeneration in the main worlds. Even prior to introducing it we didn't have problems 
            with rampant destruction in the main world. If it becomes an issue, we will re-introduce the resource 
            world.<br><br>

            Hi everyone,<br><br>

            I think I'm now fairly close to figuring out the cause of all the recent bugs, but experimentation will have to 
            be done on a test server, much of it is far too dangerous to do on the actual live server, even with backups. 
            Therefore I'm going to need to perform a download of a large number of server files (namely the entire plugins 
            folder excluding dynmap, and the resource world). I don't know how long it will take but hopefully won't be longer 
            than a couple of millennia 3-6 hours. I will be able to get a more precise estimate once the download starts. 
            We're currently 2 hours in. 7 GB transferred and 42.8 GB of data to go. Still don't have a good estimate for time, 
            but it will take a while. (2h40m in - FTP's estimate is another 2 hours)<br><br>

            The downtime will start at in 20 minutes, 1am BST (19:00 CST and 20:00 EST). Thanks for your patience.<br><br>

            large) and so it took far longer than expected to transfer. Regardless, we are now up again, under the IP of 
            obelisk.game-server.cc<br><br>

            Though I know we can't compensate the time everyone has lost, as partial compensation we will have double  McMMO 
            XP for the next 3 days.<br><br>

            I'd also like to take this opportunity to announce some new ranks we've put in place to help with server events 
            and building. We are now introducing two new roles which can be applied for: Assistant Builders and Event Assistants.

            For the past month or so, I've been developing a plugin that allows implementation of custom multiblocks. This will 
            be expanded hugely upon in the future, but I have developed the plugin to a stage where I am happy with installing 
            it on the server. For now, there are only two multiblocks: the large gold pan, and the large dust washer. These 
            machines process in stacks, and require large amounts of coolant and energy to operate.<br><br>

            For the next few days and weeks I will be beta testing these machines and the plugin on the server. If you wish to 
            take part in the test, let me know and I will show you how to use the multiblocks (as the interface is not particularly 
            intuitive at the moment). During the test, I will attempt to find and fix as many bugs as possible, and solve any 
            performance or UI issues that may pop up, particularly over a long time period.<br><br>

            If you partake in the testing, please report any of your findings in #deleted-channel or send them to me, so I can

            Hi all,<br><br>

            Recently I've been running profiles to help determine the cause of recent server lag. The main (preventable) culprit 
            seems to be bees and villagers. I'd like to ask everyone who has bees or villagers to, if possible, move them away 
            from your main base (so they are loaded less often) and/or spread them out more (entity collisions are very CPU 
            intensive). Thanks in advance :)<br><br>

        <p class = "text-news-content">
            Hi @Announcements , I think you deserve an explanation about the fiasco that happened earlier.<br><br>

            A couple of months ago, several slimefun addons broke after an incompatibility occurred with the latest version of 
            slimefun. To ensure this didn't happen again (particularly with a larger playerbase), I manually disabled auto updates 
            for many of the addons we had at the time. Unbeknown to me, claytech (which was at the centre of the incompatibility) 
            had broken because it had recently been abandoned. I occasionally manually updated the addons by checking for 
            incompatibilities in a test server, then uploading them to the main server.<br><br>

            This was all well and good until today, when infinity expansion automatically updated (I left updates for this enabled 
            because it was not previously affected by any incompatibilities). The new infinity expansion update made use of what I 
            believe was a new piece of code for handling menus, which hadn't yet been implemented in the server's slimefun version, 
            and so the plugin failed to load entirely. Normally this wouldn't be an issue because the addon's blocks would not 
            have been handled at this stage, but the error seems to have occurred after the blocks were loaded, evidently causing a 
            signifcant number of slimefun blocks to revert to vanilla blocks or vanish, along with their cargo connectors.<br><br>

            The whole thing was further complicated by the fact that we had made two major adjustments to the addons which directly 
            involved infinity expansion, so it was unclear what exactly was causing the issue; thus it took several adjustments and 
            restarts to realise the root of the problem was a version incompatibility. Once this was determined, I copied across 
            all the plugin .jar files from the test server, which was still loading correctly. That has fixed the problem for every 
            plugin.<br><br>

            To counteract anything like this happening in the future, I've re-enabled auto-updates for every slimefun addon. I've 
            also discovered that Poma expansion has been abandoned (the main repository has been deleted with no further 
            information) so we've decided to remove this from the server.<br><br>

            If you have lost any items, please message me or an administrator, and we'll attempt to sort it out<br><br>

            Hello everyone Jenkins here, a.k.a redstonepowder.<br>
            I've been marking out an area with a community project in mind.  A public wither skeleton perimeter 
            to be more specific.<br><br>

            The goal here is to let everyone have a little fun on the server that does not involve slimefun.<br><br>

            I'm sure there will be many questions about this so I'll try to pre-emptively answer some of them here. 
            Feel free to ask me anything I haven't covered in this announcement.<br><br>

            1. What is a wither skeleton perimeter?<br><
            It is essentially a wither skeleton farm, but with a LOT of space mined out around it to reduce any 
            lag that the farm would produce.<br><br>

            2. How does this work and what're we doing?<br>
            The idea is to have volunteers come and help dig out the marked area and maybe even help build the 
            farm. Special equipment will be supplied to help out in this event. (It's a secret unless you join 
            :p)<br><br>

            3. Do I HAVE to go?<br>
            No, this is strictly volunteers only.<br><br>

            4. What do I get if I participate?<br>
            Aside from having fun destroying the landscape, you also get to keep whatever you break and destroy. 
            You can also keep some special equipment along with treasures that you may find. You'll also help 
            finish it faster, meaning there will be a quick source of wither skulls, coal and exp.<br><br>

            5. What happens if no one volunteers?<br>
            Well, first off, I'd feel depressed because no one w- nah joking.<br>
            I'll still be working on it, so it'll eventually be completed, just much more slowly, and you'll 
            still have access to the farm.<br><br>

            6. How do I get to the perimeter?<br>
            Use /warp CommProj<br><br>

            If you have any further questions, or want to volunteer, go ahead and msg me.<br>
            P.S: Special equipment will be provided later, because this announcement got rushed.<br><br>

            On a related note, we've decided to be less lenient with toxicity from now on - this includes 
            insulting or flaming players, instigating arguments, and generally acting hostile. Please behave 
            yourselves. Thank you.<br><br>

            I'm not completely sure what happened last night; my best guess is chunk generating taking too 
            much RAM and crashing the server. AntiCheat was triggered but it doesn't look like it contributed 
            anything in the way of lag. Either way, I've enabled some automatic profiling configs so next time 
            it should be far easier to figure out what happened.<br><br>

            Lag spikes are probably fixed. It appears they were caused by a new plugin (LiteXpansion), should 
            be fine now.<br><br>

            Three things<br>
            1) The latest paper update broke backward compatibility. That is now fixed, and you can connect 
            with earlier versions again<br>
            2) The massive lag spike yesterday seems to have been caused by a huge number of chunks being 
            generated. If this happens again please ping me or Nethereasy, as we can't gather much more 
            information on this unless we're there at the time<br>
            3) Voting rewards should now be consistently working, though I had to remove a site<br><br>

            I recently did a timing profile to find out the cause of server lag. Craftbook is apparently 
            responsible for 6% of CPU usage per tick (the highest of any plugin), so removing it would 
            increase server performance by about 6%. I have therefore removed Craftbook. RIP.<br><br>

            Okay, enough is enough. This is not an anarchy server. I've written a script that allows you 
            to toggle 'protection,' which shows whether you wish to participate in raiding or not. Run 
            /protection to use it.<br>
            - Towny plots cannot be raided by anyone, regardless of your protection level<br>
            - Anything you don't build in a town can be raided providing your protection is disabled<br>
            - You cannot raid anyone else if your protection is enabled<br>
            - Protection can only be toggled every 48 hours<br>
            - It is your job to use /co i and /co l to find out if you have been raided illegally<br>
            - If a raid is illegal (in a towny plot or done by someone without protection disabled), the 
            raider will be banned for 3 days and the damage will be reverted<br>
            - Exceptions to these rules (eg: if two towns wish to go to war) should go through me first<br><br>

            We have now added a resource World which will be reset every month. If you wish to access it 
            you may by using the command /warp resource<br>
            You are able to rtp to a further location of this map and you can return to main world by 
            simping teleporting to a home or by teleporting to spawn via /spawn<br>
            We ask that players that wish to do large scale terraforming, excavation, etc. For it to be 
            done in this world as it will not effect the main world where players will progress their town.
