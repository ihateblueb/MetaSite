            Slimefun is like a mod, but you don't need to install anything to join a server 
            and use it. The code runs entirely on the server. Through some clever workarounds,
            Slimefun adds hundreds of new blocks and items without requiring you to install 
            anything. Of course, there are some disadvantages to this approach: for example, 
            Slimefun can't implement any new textures, although there are some unofficial 
            texture packs to do this. There are more bugs than you'd expect from a mod, as
            sometimes the workarounds required can get quite complicated and unpredictable.
            <br><br>

            That being said, one of the main reasons that Slimefun is so appealing is because 
            it is very coherent. It is relatively easy to create an addon for Slimefun due to a 
            very comprehensive API, and as a result, Slimefun has extensive community-created 
            content in the form of addons. There are currently 54 addons available (full 
            list <a href = "https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Addons" class = "text-link">here</a>)
            adding everything from custom advancements to new planets to liquid alloying, and
            most of them seamlessly integrate into one another, providing hundreds of hours
            of coherent and interesting content.<br>

            <br><br>

            However, Slimefun can be a bit unintuitive to get into. This is why we've put this
            guide together; hopefully we'll be able to provide some direction for those of you 
            new to Slimefun. Before you begin, beware that Slimefun is grindy, especially early 
            game, and requires some substantial dedication. While it's not exactly 
            <a href = "https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack" class = "text-link">GTNH</a>,
            it's still quite easy to get burnt out, and I recommend that if you start feeling 
            frustrated or burnt out, do something else until you're feeling ready to move on again. 
            Go slowly, take your time, and don't forget to ask around if you're stuck with something. 
            <br><br>

            Alright, enough talking. Let's jump into it.
        </div>
        <br>

        <button class = "collapsible-heading-small text-heading-small" onclick = "toggleCollapsible('the-slimefun-guide')">
            <i data-feather = "chevron-right" class = "collapsible-icon" id = "the-slimefun-guide-icon"></i>The Slimefun Guide
        </button>
        <div class = "text-paragraph limit-width collapsible-div" id = "the-slimefun-guide-div">
            The Slimefun Guide is a book that lets you view the recipes and functions of
            various items and machines. To access the SF guide, run <b>/sf guide</b>, and the 
            guide will spawn into your inventory. Open the guide's interface by holding the
            book and right clicking. Alternatively, you can open the interface by running
            just <b>/sf openguide</b>. Once you're there, you'll see lots of icons that
            indicate different categories - hover on each item to see the category name,
            and click the item to enter the category. You can also navigate between pages
            of categories using the two black/lime glass panes at the bottom of the guide.<br>
            <img class = "image-1-1-width image-pad" src = "image/tutorial/slimefun-guide.png">
            <br><br>

            Once you're inside a category, you'll instantly be greeted with a wall of barriers.
            Each barrier indicates a specific item, but you won't be able to craft any of the
            items yet because they must be unlocked. The name of the item will be shown when
            you hover over its corresponding barrier. Every item needs a different number of XP 
            levels to unlock, which are indicated when you hover over it. To unlock an item, 
            left click it. Try unlocking the <span class = "text-sf-item">Gold Pan</span> in 
            the <span class = "text-sf-item">Tools</span> category.<br>
            <img class = "image-1-1-width image-pad" src = "image/tutorial/gold-pan-1.png">
            <br><br>

            PS: You can also view recipes for items within recipes. For example, if you click on
            the stone while viewing the <span class = "text-sf-item">Gold Pan</span> recipe,
            the guide will show you the recipe for making stone. This will be really useful later
            on when we're dealing with recipes with tens of layers of crafting to them!
        </div>
        <br>

        <button class = "collapsible-heading-small text-heading-small" onclick = "toggleCollapsible('multiblocks')">
            <i data-feather = "chevron-right" class = "collapsible-icon" id = "multiblocks-icon"></i>Multiblocks
        </button>
        <div class = "text-paragraph limit-width collapsible-div" id = "multiblocks-div">
            Now we're ready to try and craft a <span class = "text-sf-item">Gold Pan</span>.
            However, you can't just craft Slimefun items in a regular crafting table: you'll
            need to build special structures known as 'multiblocks' to craft them. For example,
            if you click on the <span class = "text-sf-item">Gold Pan</span> and hover over the
            crafting table, you'll see that the required multiblock for crafting a
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Gold Pan</span> is an 
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Enhanced Crafting Table</span>.<br>
            <img class = "image-1-1-width image-pad" src = "image/tutorial/gold-pan-2.png">
            <br><br>
            
            Multiblocks are unique machines that must be built by placing blocks down instead 
            of being crafted. All multiblocks have their build recipes shown in the guide. Try
            navigating to the <span class = "text-sf-item">Enhanced Crafting Table</span> under
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Basic Machines</span> and looking at the recipe. Here's
            what the recipe corresponds to when built in-world:<br>
            <img class = "image-1-1-width image-pad" src = "image/tutorial/enhanced-crafting-table.png">
            <br><br>

            Try building this, and verify that you've constructed it correctly by right clicking the
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Crafting Table</span>. A message should appear in chat
            telling you that the machine inventory is empty. Now let's craft the 
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Gold Pan</span>. Navigate to the
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Gold Pan</span> in the Slimefun Guide (under
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Basic Machines</span>) and have a look at its recipe.
            Now we'll need to place the recipe inside the dispenser, like this:<br>
            <img class = "image-1-1-width image-pad" src = "image/tutorial/gold-pan-3.png">
            <br><br>

            Now right click the crafting table. A <span class = "text-sf-item">Gold Pan</span>
            should have appeared in the dispenser. Congratulations, you've crafted your first
            Slimefun item! I recommend you have a look around the guide and find some other
            useful items to craft. Keep in mind that a lot of machines and items will require
            components that you can't craft yet!
        </div>
        <br>
        
        <button class = "collapsible-heading-small text-heading-small" onclick = "toggleCollapsible('learning-metallurgy')">
            <i data-feather = "chevron-right" class = "collapsible-icon" id = "learning-metallurgy-icon"></i>Learning Metallurgy
        </button>
        <div class = "text-paragraph limit-width collapsible-div" id = "learning-metallurgy-div">
            And now, the masochism begins.<br><br>
            
            To advance from the stone age (and to start building electric machines), you're going to 
            need to learn how to create metals and alloys. For this, we're going to need to build a
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Smeltery</span> from <span class = "text-sf-item">Basic Machines</span>.
            Go ahead and build one using the guide, and note that you need to have a fire underneath the 
            dispenser. Netherrack will be useful here to make sure that said fire doesn't go out
            (though note that the fire will go out after you've processed a few recipe). If you don't have 
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Nether Bricks</span> or <span class = "text-sf-item">Netherrack</span> 
            yet, you can build a <span class = "text-sf-item">Makeshift Smeltery</span> instead for now.<br>
            <img class = "image-1-1-width image-pad" src = "image/tutorial/smeltery.png">
            <br><br>

            Okay, now we're going to need to collect some dusts to alloy with. Dusts form the foundation
            of metallurgy in Slimefun. To collect dusts, you'll need to hold that
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Gold Pan</span> you made earlier in your hand, and right click
            gravel with it. You'll receive <span class = "text-sf-item">Clay</span>, 
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Flint</span>, <span class = "text-sf-item">Iron Nuggets</span>, and 
            occasionally, <span class = "text-sf-item">Sifted Ore</span>. Once you've collected at least
            half a stack of sifted ore (you're going to need stacks upon stacks upon stacks of it in the
            future), we're going to need to wash the <span class = "text-sf-item">Sifted Ore</span> into dusts.
            <br><br>

            To do this we'll need another multiblock: the <span class = "text-sf-item">Ore Washer</span>.
            Construct an <span class = "text-sf-item">Ore Washer</span>, and place the
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Sifted Ore</span> into the dispenser. Right click the fence to
            process the <span class = "text-sf-item">Sifted Ore</span> into dusts. In the case of copper, iron,
            and gold dust, you'll be able to use an <span class = "text-sf-item">Ore Crusher</span> to convert
            ore directly into dust at a 1:2 ratio.
            <br><br>

            Now that we know how to make dusts, we can start doing some metallurgy. The first thing to know
            is that you can convert dusts into ingots by placing dust into a <span class = "text-sf-item">Smeltery</span> 
            and right clicking the fence above the dispenser. Slimefun has an ingot equivalent for each dust (apart
            from iron and gold). Note that Slimefun actually implements <span class = "text-sf-item">Copper Ingots</span> 
            separately from the vanilla <span class = "text-sf-item">Copper Ingots</span>. This is largely
            due to historic reasons, as Slimefun already implemented its own 
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Copper Ingots</span> prior to them being added to vanilla, and
            switching to using the vanilla ingots would be very difficult at this point.
            <br><br>

            Secondly, you can combine multiple metals to create an alloy. Try making some
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Nickel</span> to practice. <span class = "text-sf-item">Nickel</span> can be 
            found in the <span class = "text-sf-item">Resources</span> section. It'll soon become apparent that
            you're going to need to make a <i>lot</i> of nickel, and in fact you will spend a lot of time
            collecting dust and alloying early game. In mid game, you'll be able to automate dust production
            and alloying completely, but for now you're stuck with doing it manually.
        </div>
        <br><br>



        <h class = "text-heading-medium">Logistics</h>
        <br>

        <button class = "collapsible-heading-small text-heading-small" onclick = "toggleCollapsible('cargo-basics')">
            <i data-feather = "chevron-right" class = "collapsible-icon" id = "cargo-basics-icon"></i>Cargo Basics

        <div class = "text-paragraph limit-width collapsible-div" id = "cargo-basics-div">
            Sooner or later, you're going to find yourself needing to move large quantities of items from point A to point B.
            This is where cargo becomes useful. 'But Idra, why not just use hoppers??!?!?!' Good question. Firstly, hoppers are
            too slow to move the thousands of items per minute that you will be producing once you reach endgame. Secondly, 
            hoppers can't actually interact with Slimefun machines, making them practically useless in the context of Sliefun.
            <br><br>

            Cargo is quite unintuitive, so we recommend you to craft at least a couple of all the following components before you 
            follow this section of the tutorial. The cargo system is comprised of only four key items, but contained within those
            four items is huge potential for automation:<br><br>
            
            <b> <span class = "text-sf-item-heading">Cargo Manager</span></b><br>
            A Cargo Manager is required for a system to be established. It connects all the other components together, so not 
            having (exactly) one of these in your system will render all other components useless.
            <br><br>
            
            <b> <span class = "text-sf-item-heading">Cargo Node (Connector)</span></b><br>
            Connector nodes extends the cargo network, allowing you to connect more components to the system.
            <br><br>

            <b> <span class = "text-sf-item-heading">Cargo Node (input)</span></b><br>
            Input nodes takes items from the container/machine they are attached to and send their items to <span class = "text-sf-item">Output Nodes.</span>
            <br><br>

            <b> <span class = "text-sf-item-heading">Cargo Node (output)</span></b><br>
            Output nodes receive items from <span class = "text-sf-item">Input Nodes</span> and output their items in the container/machine they are attached to.
            The <span class = "text-sf-item">Advanced Output Nodes</span> will allow you to whitelist or blacklist what it receives.
            <br><br>

            Now that you know what each piece does, it's time for the details. Start by placing a 
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Cargo Manager</span>, the centerpiece of your system. 
            In order for your cargo nodes to connect to the system, they need to be within range of a 
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Cargo Manager</span> or <span class = "text-sf-item">Connector Node</span>. The range extends 
            6 blocks out from the <span class = "text-sf-item">Cargo Manager</span> or <span class = "text-sf-item">Connector Node</span>
            in all 6 cardinal directions:
            <img class = "image-1-2-width image-pad" src = "image/tutorial/cargo-node-range.png">
            <br><br>
        </div>
        <br>

        <button class = "collapsible-heading-small text-heading-small" onclick = "toggleCollapsible('cargo-input-nodes')">
            <i data-feather = "chevron-right" class = "collapsible-icon" id = "cargo-input-nodes-icon"></i>Cargo Input Nodes
        </button>
        <div class = "text-paragraph limit-width collapsible-div" id = "cargo-input-nodes-div">
            With the basics of how to connect nodes to your system down, let's start moving items around. First, place down a container or machine
            and attach an <span class = "text-sf-item">Input Node</span> to its side (you can't attach them on top or bottom). Make sure 
            that the <span class = "text-sf-item">Input Node</span> is within range of your system. Right click the node to bring up its settings 
            interface. You'll see a couple of different options.
            <br><br>

            <b><span class = "text-sf-item-heading">Whitelist/Blacklist</span></b><br>
            The node can be toggled between whitelist and blacklist mode using the <span class = "text-sf-item">White Wool</span>button. In 
            whitelist mode, the node will only take items from the attached container/machine that are present in the 3x3 grid in the interface. In
            blacklist mode, the node will take items from the attached container/machine that are <i>not</i> present in the 3x3 grid. If you want the
            node to take everything inside the container/machine, you can just enable blacklist mode and leave the 3x3 grid empty.
            <br><br>

            <b><span class = "text-sf-item-heading">Smart Filling</span></b><br>
            Smart Filling mode can be toggled with the <span class = "text-sf-item">Book and Quill</span>button. Smart filling node isn't important 
            until you start setting up autocrafters, but if smart filling node is enabled, the node will only send items to output nodes if the
            containers/machines that each output node is attached to do not contain more than a stack of items.

            <b><span class = "text-sf-item-heading">Round Robin</span></b><br>
            Round Robin mode can be toggled with the <span class = "text-sf-item">Energy Regulator</span>button. If round robin mode is disabled,
            every time the system ticks, the node will check each output node in the network in turn and attempt to send items to it. The next 
            tick, the node will start from the same node and check each node in turn again. This may result in some nodes receiving lots of items,
            while some nodes don't receive many at all. Round robin mode solves this by trying to distribute the items evenly to all connected
            output nodes.

            <b><span class = "text-sf-item-heading">Channels</span></b><br>
            Each input or output node uses a specific channel. The chanel can be viewed by hovering over the
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Wool</span> in the interface, and adjusted by clicking the two buttons next to the 
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Wool</span>. If two nodes are not on the same channel, they will not send items to each other. This
            lets you effectively have several different cargo systems in one - for example, you could have one channel for disposal, one channel
            for autocrafting, one channel for a sorting system, and so on.
            <br><br>
        </div>
        <br>

        <button class = "collapsible-heading-small text-heading-small" onclick = "toggleCollapsible('cargo-output-nodes')">
            <i data-feather = "chevron-right" class = "collapsible-icon" id = "cargo-output-nodes-icon"></i>Cargo Output Nodes
        </button>
        <div class = "text-paragraph limit-width collapsible-div" id = "cargo-output-nodes-div">
            Now that we have an <span class = "text-sf-item">Input Node</span>, we'll need an <span class = "text-sf-item">Output Node</span> 
            to move items to. Attach an <span class = "text-sf-item">Output Node</span> to the side of a container/machine, and right click to
            open the interface.
            <br><br>

            You'll see that there's only one option this time, which is the channel. We've already covered channels in the
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Input Node</span> section.
            <br><br>

            The <span class = "text-sf-item">Advanced Output Nodes</span> will allow you to whitelist or blacklist what they receive, but are
            a bit more complicated to work with. However, they are definitely worth it once you start scaling up, as otherwise managing the flow
            of items can get very complicated very quickly.
            <br><br>

            Place down another container/machine and attach an <span class = "text-sf-item">Output Node</span> on its side. Make sure that both the
            <span class = "text-sf-item">Input Node</span> and <span class = "text-sf-item">Output Node</span> are on the channel. As usual, also
            make sure that the output node is within range of your system.
            <br><br>

            If everything is set up correctly, the contents of the first container should be constantly moved into the second container. That's about
            all there is to cargo - there are a few more niche things you can do with it, but those are beyond the scope of this tutorial, and we'll
            leave it to you to find them. Good luck automating!
