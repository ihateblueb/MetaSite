            So you're interested in become a builder? Great! Our builders are involved in constructing spawns and minigames. 
            Although we have just finished our third and likely final spawn, there is plenty of work to be done improving the
            spawns and building new minigames for our weekly events. There are currently several interesting projects on the 
            TODO list, but there is comparatively little pressure to get them done, so you'll be building in a relaxed atmosphere 
            with pleasant people.<br><br>

            Aria_Night (aka QueenOfCurry) heads the build team and organises projects, but you will still have plenty of flexibility 
            to work on what you want. The rest of the staff team also occasionally helps with builds.

            That's all for requirements. I recommend you write down your answers somewhere else first, in case the 
            submission process fails somehow, and for you to refer to in the future. Remember, the more detailed your 
            responses are, the better! Good luck.
