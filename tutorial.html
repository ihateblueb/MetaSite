        <h class = "text-heading-small">What is Slimefun?</h>
        <p class = "text-paragraph limit-width">
            You may be familiar with modifications (AKA mods). Mods bring new content 
            to the game: new mobs, landscape, machines, armour, you name it. However,
            mods must be installed on your computer. You can't use mods on a server with
            a vanilla client; instead, you must install a modloader (such as Forge or Fabric) and
            then install the mods you wish to play with.
            <br><br>
            Slimefun is like a mod, but any vanilla client can join the server and use it.
            Through a set of clever techniques and workarounds, Slimefun adds hundreds of
            new blocks and items without requiring you to install anything. Of course, there
            are some disadvantages to this: for example, Slimefun can't implement any new
            textures, although there are some unofficial texture packs to do this.
            <br><br>
            One of the main reasons that Slimefun is so appealing is because it is very
            coherent. It is relatively easy to create an addon for Slimefun due to a very
            comprehensive API, and as a result, Slimefun has extensive community-created 
            content in the form of addons. There are currently 54 plugins available (full 
            list <a href = "https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Addons" class = "text-link">here</a>),
            adding everything from custom advancements to new planets to liquid alloying. The 
            result of this is potentially hundreds of hours of varied content.
            <br><br>
            However, Slimefun can be a bit unintuitive to get into. This is why we've put this
            guide together to hopefully provide some direction for those of you new to Slimefun.
            Before you begin, beware that Slimefun is grindy, especially early game, and
            requires some substantial dedication. It's therefore quite easy to get burnt 
            out, and I recommend that if you start feeling frustrated or burnt out, do something
            else until you're feeling ready to move on again. Go slowly, take your time, and
            don't forget to ask around if you're stuck with something. 
            <br><br>
            Good luck!

        <h class = "text-heading-small">The Slimefun Guide</h>
        <p class = "text-paragraph limit-width">
            The Slimefun Guide is a book that allows you to view the recipes and functions of
            various items and machines. To access the SF guide, run /sf guide, and the guide 
            will spawn into your inventory. Open the book by holding it and right clicking. 
            Navigate by clicking the different icons, and exit by pressing esc.
            <br><br>
            The Slimefun Guide is divided into many categories, with each category containing 
            many different items and machines. Some categories contain sub-categories of their own.
            Before you are able to craft and use an item, you'll need to unlock it. Each item
            needs a different number of XP levels to unlock, indicated when you hover over it.
            To unlock an item, left click it. Try unlocking the Gold Pan:<br>

        <h class = "text-heading-small">Multiblocks</h>
        <p class = "text-paragraph limit-width">
            Multiblocks are unique machines that must be built by placing blocks down instead 
            of being crafted, amongst which the Enhanced Crafting Table is included. All 
            multiblocks have their build recipes shown in the SF guidebook, a column in the 
            guidebook is 3 blocks tall and 1 block wide, while a row is 1 block tall and 3 
            blocks wide.

            To create the Enhanced Crafting Table you will need to place a workbench on top of 
            a dispenser. To confirm if you have built it correctly, right click on the crafting 
            table, if the vanilla crafting gui appears, you have done it wrong.

            To use the Enhanced Crafting Table right click the dispenser, place the items as
            shown in the guidebook, exit the dispenser gui and then right click the crafting 
            table. A successful craft will be accompanied by a click sound.
            
            Congratulations, you've taken the first step.
